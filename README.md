# File System in C

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive implementation of a file system in C, developed for a system-oriented programming course. It is inspired by the UnixV6 project and involves various aspects of file system management and manipulation.

## Key Features
- Setting up and listing inodes.
- SHA calculation for files and inode reading.
- Implementation of directory structures.
- Mounting the filesystem with FUSE.
- Utilization of bitmap vectors.
- Writing inodes and handling small files.
- Final project compilation and integration.

## Technical Details
- The project follows the UnixV6 file system model.
- Implementation in C, demonstrating deep understanding of low-level system programming.

## Project Phases
- Initial setup and inode listing.
- Functional checks and directory management.
- Finalization and comprehensive testing.

## Usage
Refer to the provided documentation for detailed instructions on setting up and running the file system.
